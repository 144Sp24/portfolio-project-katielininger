                    <p> Hi, I'm Katie! I am currently in my junior year at Northwest Missouri State University working towards earning my bachelor's degree in Digital Media: Visual Imaging with an expected graduation date of May 2025. My classes have provided me with experience in several different areas in media design.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="tablet-desktop">I grew up in a small town called Olathe in Colorado. There I was constantly surrounded with creativity as my mother is a very creative and artistic individual. Naturally, I followed in her footsteps and attained a passion for art and design which led me to where I am today. My goal is to eventually have my own business designing print and digital media for clients</p>
            <p> My work experience includes independent artwork both commissioned and non-commissioned which includes artwork I create for myself and others, respectively. I have also worked highly customer-oriented roles such as barista and medical reception providing me with proficient skills in customer and client relations, time management, problem-solving, and working under pressure.</p>
            <div id="bottom-ab-p">
                <p> Skills I have obtained through work and coursework experience consist of proficiency in Adobe programs such as InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Lightroom, Microsoft Office apps, and photo camera operations. I am creative, detail-oriented, punctual, able to adapt easily, and a quick learner.</p>
